## About The Project

This is a simple app that is mimicked off fantasy draft applications. You can select a Marvel characters and add them to your team and share what team you created. You can have a max of 5 characters on your team, a Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder, Striker, and the last character can be any outfield position. 

To add characters simply click on the empty locations and a character list will appear. From here you can search for a character or choose one from the list. To add another position click the small + on the character cards. You can remove characters by clicking on them and clicking the "remove" button. Click the twitter (or X?) logo to share, this will prompt the user to save a screen shot and to twitter to share.
